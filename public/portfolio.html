<h2>Clothing Brand Application</h2>
<p>This project implements a multithreaded client-server application in Python for a clothing brand. It was developed as a team university assignment to practice multithreading, concurrent programming, network programming, and GUI development with Tkinter.</p>
<p>The client application will be used by the various stores of the brand. The customers can visit a store to look at item samples and try them on. If the customer would like to purchase items, the store owner then places an order from the central warehouse to be delivered to the customer.
    A store owner will be responsible for reporting the purchases and returns of the store, and sending them to the server, and the analysis team at headquarters will be responsible for requesting some statistics related to the operations, which will be generated on the server.</p>

<h2>CyprusDryClean: A Dry-Cleaning Management System</h2>
<p>This Java application is designed for a dry-cleaning company called CyprusDryClean which is an university project. The application helps manage:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Customers (Subscribed/Unsubscribed)</li>
    <li>Employees and their duties</li>
    <li>Orders and laundry items (runtime only, not persisted in this assignment)</li>
    <li>The application is implemented according to the provided UML class diagram.</li>
    <li>Inheritance is used (e.g., SubscribedCustomer and UnsubscribedCustomer inherit from Customer).</li>
    <li>Polymorphism is applied in methods like calculateDiscount() and compareTo(), allowing different customer types to behave differently while sharing the same interface.</li>
    <li>Encapsulation ensures that class fields are private and accessed via getters/setters.</li>
</ol>
